    Mutate the given population with gene-wise probability p_mutation.

    Takes the population and alters each gene of each individual with
    probability p_mutation; takes place in-place, so as to avoid having to
    copy over the full population every generation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    population : np.ndarray[bool]
        Population expressed as Boolean array with each row corresponding
        to an individual and each column to a gene.
    p_mutation : float or NoneType, optional
        Probability of mutation per gene. If set to None, the "standard" value

    Parameters
    ----------
    population : np.ndarray[bool]
        Population on which to perform cross-over.
    n_crossover : int or str
        Number of crossover points. Supports values of 1 up to
        population.shape[1], and "uniform", which applies uniform crossover.
        If "uniform", p_crossover is the crossover probability of individual
        genes. If int, the crossover locations are chosen at random.
    p_crossover : float
        Probability that a given sequential pair undergoes crossover.
        Common values are .6 [1] or .75-.95 [2].
    p_gene_crossover : float or NoneType, optional
        If n_crossover is set to "uniform", this determines the probability
        of crossover per individual gene. If n_crossover is set to an integer
        value, this parameter is not used and can be set to None.

    Returns
